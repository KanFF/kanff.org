			"name": "Projects segmentation",
			"description": "When we carry out large-scale projects that last several months or even years, there are many tasks to manage. That's why in KanFF tasks are not only linked to a project but to a part of a project (called works). \n\nOnly works in progress, on break or done are displayed in the kanban. The done ones are reducted.",

			"name": "Global vision",
			"description": "By default, everything that happens in different projects is visible for the whole collective. That permits to have a global vision of what concretely happens in the collective and on the progress of projects. \nIntegration of new persons within existing projects is easier too because the project history is conserved (old works and the logbook), and participants, deadlines and tasks to do, are readable.

It is evolving and enhanced from time to time.",

So it's possible to self-host and instance and to have full control over your data. \n\nThis transparency makes it possible to inspect the database, the code, the algorithms and to verify that the documentation is not malicious. KanFF does not have a free license yet, but it will come soon.",

		"intro": "KanFF is not only an application. It's a big project that is now 1 year old (started the 26.04.2020)",
		"text": "To have a quick preview, this year includes 10 months of work on free time, more than 600 jours cumulated of work, 10 beta releases, 4 database versions, ... \n\nHowever, the application is not finished yet and a first stable version won't be released until several months. This school project has started with 6 apprentices in IT in the 2-3rd year. The project took place during 3 quarters (with 6 then 4 then 2 persons) in class and at home. Now the courses dedicated to this project are done, but the adventure continues with Samuel et Benoît!"
